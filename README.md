# Natours

Natours is a project designed and developed by Jonas Schmedtmann to demonstrate advance CSS techniques, CSS animations, SASS and CSS architecture.In this project Jonas Schmedtmann uses float for the layout of elements in the page.

I use this project to apply my CSS Grid and Flexbox knowledge and skill. So, I refactor the code to use CSS Grid and Flexbox for the layout instead.
